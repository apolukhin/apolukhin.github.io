    <h2>I. Quick Introduction</h2>
    <p>[class.copy.elision]
    in the current working draft provides a whitelist of cases when copy elision is permitted. Those rules are good! However they
    do not take into account that modern compilers could inline functions and that modern compilers have link time optimizations.</p>
    <p>This paper provides motivation for a future proposals to relax the [class.copy.elision] rules in order to allow compilers to produce much better code.</p>

    <h2>II. The pitfall</h2>
    <h3>A. Teaching practice</h3>
    <p>For decades almost all the teaching materials were telling people to decompose program into functions for maintainability and code re-usability.
    That good advice leads to code with many functions. Compiler developers noted that and started inlining functions more aggressively.
    Currently inlining is one of the major optimizations [1].</p>

    <h3>B. Copy elision rules</h3>
    <p>Current rules for copy elision mostly assume that there's a preallocated fixed size storage
    and allow to elide copying of local non-reference variables into that storage. This works perfectly fine in a world without inlining, aliasing reasoning and link time optimization.</p>
    <p>But that's not true for modern compilers. If the function is inlined then the compiler "sees" the whole function body along with function parameters.
    This unleashes a whole new world of optimizations (See section III for examples).</p>

    <h3>C. std::move/rvalues is not a panacea</h3>
    <p>We have std::array, std::basic_string, std::function, std::variant, std::optional and other classes that may store a lot of data on the stack.
    "Moving" instances of those classes may result in copying a lot of bytes.</p>

    <h3>D. std::move/rvalues rules may be obscure</h3>
    <p>What is the optimal way to return something from a function? For named object we must just return. For a subobject we must return it with std::move.
    For a function parameter we must return it by std::move. If we return a reference to local object we have to std::move it.
    We must also return elements from structured binding by std::move, but only if the element is not a reference to an value returned by reference before decomposition... 
    Do we have to apply std::move for a member function call on a local variable when the function call returns reference?..</p>

    <h3>E. Sum up</h3>
    <p>We were teaching people for decades to write functions and improving the C++ language by providing features for advanced programmers to optimize the functions
    leaving behind the abilities of modern compilers to do that job out-of-the-box.</p>


    <h2>III. Examples of possible optimizations</h2>
    <p>All the examples in this section use the following includes and classes</p>
<pre class="lmargin50">
struct detect_copy {
    detect_copy() noexcept = default;
    detect_copy(const detect_copy&amp;) noexcept;
    ~detect_copy();
    int modify() noexcept;
};

struct pair {
    detect_copy first, second;
};
</pre>




    <h3>A. Returning function parameter</h3>

<pre class="lmargin50">
static detect_copy callee(detect_copy v) {
    return v;
}

int caller() {
    auto v = callee(detect_copy{});
    return v.modify();
}</pre>

<p>[class.copy.elision] forbids copy elision if function parameter is returned. However modern compilers do inline the <code>callee</code>. This results in a copy constructor call immediately followed by a call to the destructor: <a href="https://godbolt.org/g/nYovU3">https://godbolt.org/g/nYovU3</a>.</p>

<p>Code could be optimized by the compiler to the following, avoiding calls to copy constructor and destructor:</p>
<pre class="lmargin50">
int caller() {
    detect_copy v;
    return v.modify();
}</pre>

    <h3>B. Returning reference to a local</h3>

<pre class="lmargin50">
static detect_copy callee() {
    detect_copy v;
    auto& ref = v;
    return ref;
}

int caller() {
    return callee().modify();
}</pre>

    <p>[class.copy.elision] forbids copy elision if reference is returned. However modern compilers do understand that <code>ref</code> is just a reference to <code>v</code>.
    This could be seen from assembly where no separate variable/register is used for a <code>ref</code>: <a href="https://godbolt.org/g/YMAAN4">https://godbolt.org/g/YMAAN4</a>. Note the call to the copy constructor immediately followed by a call to the destructor.</p>

<p>It means that the code could be optimized by the compiler to the following, avoiding calls to copy constructor and destructor:</p>
<pre class="lmargin50">
int caller() {
    detect_copy v;
    return v.modify();
}</pre>


    <h3>C. Returning subobject</h3>

<pre class="lmargin50">
static detect_copy callee() {
    pair v;
    return v.second;
}

int caller() {
    return callee().modify();
}</pre>

<p>[class.copy.elision] forbids copy elision if subobject is returned. However modern compilers do understand that <code>pair</code> could be
    treated as two <code>detect_copy</code> variables because <code>pair</code> has default destructor.
    The copy constructor call is immediately followed by a call to the destructor for the same register: <a href="https://godbolt.org/g/kyPR7R">https://godbolt.org/g/kyPR7R</a>.</p>

<p>Code could be optimized by the compiler to avoid calls to copy constructor and destructor:</p>
<pre class="lmargin50">
int caller() {
    detect_copy first;
    { detect_copy second; }
    return first.modify();
}</pre>



    <h3>D. Returning union element</h3>
<pre class="lmargin50">
union optional {
    bool fake;
    detect_copy data;

    optional()
        : data{}
    {}

    ~optional(){
        data.~detect_copy();
    }
};

static detect_copy callee() {
    optional v;
    return v.data;
}

int caller() {
    return callee().modify();
}</pre>

<p>[class.copy.elision] forbids copy elision if union element is returned. However modern compilers have knowledge of the active union member, because they do check that in constexpr calls.
    In the above example copy constructor call is immediately followed by a call to the destructor for the same memory: <a href="https://godbolt.org/g/Udb7vN">https://godbolt.org/g/Udb7vN</a>.</p>

<p>Code could be optimized by the compiler to avoid calls to copy constructor and destructor:</p>
<pre class="lmargin50">
int caller() {
    detect_copy v;
    return v.modify();
}</pre>



    <h3>E. Returning element from structured binding</h3>
<pre class="lmargin50">
static detect_copy callee() {
    auto [f, s] = pair{};
    return s;
}

int caller() {
    return callee().modify();
}</pre>

<p>[class.copy.elision] forbids copy elision if reference to the subobject is returned. However modern compilers do understand that <code>s</code> is just a reference to <code>pair{}.second</code>.
    This could be seen from assembly where no separate variable/register is used for a <code>s</code>: <a href="https://godbolt.org/g/quV9Cp">https://godbolt.org/g/quV9Cp</a>. Note the call to the copy constructor immediately followed by a call to the destructor for the same memory.</p>

<p>Code could be optimized by the compiler to avoid calls to copy constructor and destructor:</p>
<pre class="lmargin50">
int caller() {
    detect_copy first;
    { detect_copy second; }
    return first.modify();
}</pre>


    <h2>IV. Addressing common concerns</h2>
    <p><b>Concern:</b> Eliding copy constructors could break user code</p>
    <p>Yes. Committee already was doing that when adding new rules to the [class.copy.elision] and it was assumed to be OK [n1725].</p>

    <p><b>Concern:</b> Examples do not look like a real world code. Nobody writes such a bad code</p>
    <p>Examples are simplified just to show that the optimization is possible. Real code would have functions located in different headers, more code will be in the function body.
    We searched the Yandex code base for <code>return.*first;</code> and <code>return.*second;</code> and found thousands of matches. Note we searched only for a single optimization
    case for only a std::pair. Tuples, aggregates and more complex data types are also affected.</p>

    <p><b>Concern:</b> Advanced optimizations could affect compilation time</p>
    <p>That depends. Making a high level optimization could be faster than doing a lot of low level optimizations. For example removing copy constructor and destructor could be faster
    than inlining both and optimizing all the internals.</p>
    <p>Anyway, to implement or not to implement a particular optimization is up to the compiler developers. This proposal just attempts to untie their hands and allow more optimizations.</p>

    <p><b>Concern:</b> It is impossible to implement some of the optimizations right now.</p>
    <p>Proposal does not require any of the optimizations from examples. Proposal attempts to relax copy elision rules to allow those optimizations someday.</p>

    <p><b>Concern:</b> We want an emergency hatch to disable copy elision for particular places.</p>
    <p>Usual practice to disable optimizations for a variable is to make it <code>volatile</code>. This feature must be kept.</p>

    <h2>V. Ultimate solution for relaxing [class.copy.elision]</h2>
    <p>Adjust the [class.copy.elision] paragraph 1 to allow copy elision of all objects and subobjects:</p>
    <div class="lmargin50 stdquote">
    <p>This elision of copy/move operations, called copy elision, is permitted
    in the following circumstances (which may be combined to eliminate multiple copies):
    </p>
    <p>&ndash; in a return statement in a function with a class return type, when the expression is the name of
    a non-volatile automatic object (other than a function parameter or a variable introduced by the
    exception-declaration of a handler (18.3)) with the same type (ignoring cv-qualification) as the function
    return type, the copy/move operation can be omitted by constructing the automatic object directly
    into the function call’s return object</p>

    <p>&ndash; in a throw-expression (8.17), when the operand is the name of a non-volatile automatic object (other than
    a function or catch-clause parameter) whose scope does not extend beyond the end of the innermost
    enclosing try-block (if there is one), the copy/move operation from the operand to the exception
    object (18.1) can be omitted by constructing the automatic object directly into the exception object</p>

    <p>&ndash; when the exception-declaration of an exception handler (Clause 18) declares an object of the same
    type (except for cv-qualification) as the exception object (18.1), the copy operation can be omitted by
    treating the exception-declaration as an alias for the exception object if the meaning of the program will
    be unchanged except for the execution of constructors and destructors for the object declared by the
    exception-declaration. [ Note: There cannot be a move from the exception object because it is always
    an lvalue. — end note ]</p>

    <p><span class="cppdeletion">Copy elision is</span><span class="cppaddition">Above copy elisions are</span> required where an expression is evaluated in a context requiring a constant expression (8.6)
and in constant initialization (6.8.3.2). [ Note: Copy elision might not be performed if the same expression is
evaluated in another context. — end note ]</p>
    <p class="cppaddition">Additionally, copy elision is allowed for any non-volatile object or it's non-volatile nested object if
    source is not accessed between a copy/move construction of it and its destruction.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>VI. Other ways of relaxing [class.copy.elision]</h2>
    <p>We can deal with each of the elision cases from the Section III of this paper separately. Such approach is used in P0878 paper.</p>
